## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

HTML Structure and Semantics:

```
i) Learned how to structure a simple webpage using semantic HTML
   elements like <div>, <h2>, and <h3>.
ii) Gained experience in organizing content for better readability
    and accessibility.
```

CSS Styling:

```
i) Practiced using CSS to style elements,including properties like
   border-radius, gap, padding, and font-family.
ii) Learned how to use @import to include Google Fonts in a project.

```

Flexbox Layout:
```
Gained experience in using Flexbox properties like display: flex,
flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items to center and align elements.
```

### Continued development

While working on this project, I faced challenges in making the webpage fully responsive across different screen sizes. Specifically, I found it difficult to adjust the layout and element dimensions to ensure a consistent user experience on both small and large devices.

To refine this aspect of my skills, I plan to:
```
a) Deepen my understanding of CSS media queries and how to use them effectively for responsive design.
b) Explore advanced responsive design techniques, such as using CSS Grid alongside Flexbox for more complex layouts.
c) Practice creating responsive designs for a variety of screen sizes, including tablets and desktops, to improve adaptability.
d) Study best practices for using relative units like vw, vh, and percentages to create fluid layouts.
e) By focusing on these areas, I aim to enhance my ability to build fully responsive and user-friendly web pages in future projects.
```
